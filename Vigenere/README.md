# Vigenere
A program that decrypts a vigenere cipher.

### Purpose 
Vigenere Ciphers are susceptible to being cracked via Kasiski Tests and using Index of Coincidence calculations to confirm the Kasiski Test. This program
calculates both and uses them to find the keyword necessary to decrypt the cipher.

### Running Instructions
Download the .zip file and extract all the files. The code was created using the IntelliJ IDE, but any method of running java will suffice. Open the folder
and run the Vigenere.java class. 

The program will output the stripped ciphertext followed by the stripped plaintext. 

#### Files:
- cipher.txt: input ciphertext

- Vigenere.java: driver class that handles decryption for this ciphertext

- output.txt: output plaintext (stripped)
