# Permuation
A program that decrypts a monoalphabetic substitution cipher.

### Purpose 
This program uses frequency analysis to find the substitution table and applies the inverse table to the ciphertext.

### Running Instructions
Download the .zip file and extract all the files. The code was created using the IntelliJ IDE, but any method of running java will suffice. Open the folder
and run the Permutation.java class. 

The program will output the stripped ciphertext followed by the stripped plaintext. It will also output to a text file called "output.txt"

#### Files:
- Substitution.java: driver class that decrypts this ciphertext

- cipher3.txt: input cipher file

- output.txt: output plaintext file (stripped)
