# Hill
A program that decrypts a hill cipher.

### Purpose 
This program determines the matrix key for the cipher and calculates the inverse key for decryption. 

### Running Instructions
Download the .zip file and extract all the files. The code was created using the IntelliJ IDE, but any method of running java will suffice. Open the folder
and run the Permutation.java class. 

The program will output the stripped ciphertext followed by the stripped plaintext. It will also write out the decrypted solution to output.txt

#### Files: 
- cipher.txt: input ciphertext

- Hill.java: driver class that decrypts the ciphertext

- output.txt: output plaintext (stripped)
